## Why?
The **HubSpot CLI** is a useful tool for connecting local development tools with HubSpot. However, integrating it smoothly into the development process can be a challenge, as there is no easy way to consolidate all local development tasks into one tool. To simplify the process and have one tool to manage all local development tasks, we created our own library that utilizes HubSpot CLI and allows for seamless integration with other tools.

**For example**, to compile `SCSS` files and upload them using the `hubspot-cli` **Watch** process, you typically need multiple tools or steps. This includes some task manager that can compile `SCSS`, copy `CSS`, and run a **Watch** process, as well as the `hubspot-cli` **Watch/Upload** process to upload the compiled files. However, with `@resultify/hubspot-cms-lib`, you only need one step. The **Watch** process combines `SCSS`, `PostCSS`, and `Rolup.js` compilers with the Hubspot CLI Watch and Upload process, allowing you to accomplish everything with just one CLI command: `npm run watch`

## Custom multi-account authentication

1. add `.env` file to your theme
2. add the name of the portal with the prefix `hub_` as the variable name and the `personal access key` as the variable value
3. Run Hubspot Theme commands (fetch, upload, watch)

### `.env` file example

```
hub_sandbox=personal_access_key for sandbox portal
hub_project1=personal_access_key for project1 portal
hub_project2=personal_access_key for project2 portal
```
